# Nix2 CLI
*Nix2 Command Line Interface*

## Installation
All you need is to install is node
`$ npm i -g @nix2/nix-cli`

## Usage

The basic command is `nix-cli` which if you are using the [zsh plugin](https://github.com/nix2io/cli-zsh-plugin) given an alias of `dev`.
The rest of the documentation uses `dev` but should be the same for `nix-cli`.

When running that command you should see a list of all avaliable commands
```sh

```
